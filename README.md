This project demonstrates the application of Google Earth Engine in developing a spatial analysis tool for examining the population context and socioeconomic development of resident populations around the National Forests in the United States of interest. 

Understanding the relationship between human society and the environment has become crucial in conservations of the national forests; however, difficulties exist in examining the human settlements and visualizing the socioeconomic changes around national forests across different places and times. Thus, being able to easily visualize the demographic profile and socioeconomic changes over years in populations around any of the national forests of interest is a key step in ultimately being able to interpret and use the information for research and environmental conservation.
